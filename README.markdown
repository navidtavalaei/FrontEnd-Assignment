Front-end development in HTML, CSS (and Javascript) |
The main objective of this project is to implement my learnings in HTML, CSS, JS.
I created a webpage for BTS students to find out how many days is left to the graduation date.
I have included the following features/changes to practice some of my learnings in this class:

1) Creating page parallax scroll effect
2) Adding a youtube video
3) Adding a page with countdown
4) changeing background images
5) changing style & size of fonts
6) Removing some elements from the original source

Here is a screen shot of the original source:
